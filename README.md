## Fix: Failed to load window layout

In case you are getting the "Failed to load window layout" error when opening the project do the following to fix this.

1. Close Unity/ Unity Hub.
2. Open the following folder
   1. If you are using <kbd>Windows</kbd> open `AppData\Roaming\Unity\Editor-5.x\Preferences\Layouts\default`.
   2. If you are using <kbd>Mac</kbd> open `~/Library/Preferences/Unity/Editor-5.x/Layouts/default`.
3. Delete the file `LastLayout.dwlt`.
4. Copy the file `Default.wlt` and paste it into `path/to/BIS21-assigment1-unity-intro/Library`.
5. Delete `CurrentLayout-default.dwlt`.
6. Rename `Default.wlt` to `CurrentLayout-default.dwlt`.
7. Back when opening the Unity project go to the _Layout_ dropdown (top-right corner of the window) and click on _Revert Factory Settings..._.

BTW this error gets caused due to the _UserSettings_ folder (now deleted in this repo) which got introduced in Unity 2020. Be sure when publishing to GitHub you have the newest [`.gitignore`](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Unity.gitignore) which also excludes the _UserSettings_ folder.
